Hi, Thanks for the opportunity to bid on your project. 
I read your job description carefully.
Also, I am an expert in Python with 5 years of experience.
I scrapped many websites using selenium webdriver and automated website logic.
And then I have experience in integrating google spreadsheet and python selenium.
I'm going to tell you about my scraping project similiar to your project.
In my project, I automated login process and uploading game details.
Here, I bypassed recaptcha without api and game details were in google spreadsheet.
I integrated google spreadsheet and selenium so I get details automatically from google spreadsheet. 
And I can save scraped data into excel.
I made executable file using pyinstaller. I attached my working file.
I understand your project and I'm confident with your project.
I'd like to work for you.
I'll wait for your message. Thanks for your kind consideration.
