What interests you the most about building a freelance career?

One of the things that I find most appealing about building a freelance career is the opportunity to have more control over my work and schedule. As a freelancer, I would have the flexibility to choose the projects that I work on, set my own hours, and work from anywhere in the world. This level of autonomy is very important to me, as I value being able to manage my time and priorities in a way that works best for me.

Another aspect of freelancing that interests me is the potential for greater financial rewards. Unlike traditional employment where salaries are predetermined, freelancers have the ability to negotiate their rates and earn more based on the value they provide to clients. This can be especially rewarding for those who are motivated by financial success.

Finally, I am drawn to the idea of being able to pursue multiple passions and interests at once through freelancing. As a freelancer, I could take on projects in various industries and explore different types of work. This variety and unpredictability appeals to me, as I enjoy learning new things and taking on new challenges.

When working with a client remotely, what do you consider the key to success?

I think the key to success is Trust.
When I work with a client remotely, the client and I cannot exactly feel thinking and attitude each other.
Hence, building trust with the remote client is crucial. 
I'm sure my deliver on my promises and meet deadlines. 
I will show them that they can rely on me to get the job done right.
