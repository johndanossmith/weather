Hello,

I saw yourthat you are the creators of .............. so I recorded a 5min screencast with some commments about the copy on your website and options for the future crowd funding campaign. I think a few changes in the message flow could dramatically increase your conversion.

Otherwise, I'm very fond of your products, both the community and ........... . I know first hand how life-changing it is to have real support and train oneself in positive thinking. I've been using Happify app for almost two years and I think it's important to have more such apps, products, and communicates dedicated to inreasing personal and overall happiness.
If you want to collaborate with me lets discuss it in more detail over the chat.

Kind regards,

Hello!
I'd really like to work with you on this one if possible!
I do have a couple of questions, but first I'd like to make you an offer and some background so you can check my work out. 

My name is Gray and I am a designer with nearly 20 years of experience, with 9 of those years in online gaming and games design. A lot of the games I have designed are slots and mobile games, so I am pretty familiar with what you need doing. 
However, I am new to upwork and looking to get a few clients that I can build upon. If you take a look at my work and feel that I could help you, I'll do it for a 10% discount.
You'll get all the expected stuff like a great professional services and a fast turn around, at a bit less, and I get a bit more exposure.
You can have a look at my portfolio here http://graywalsh.commments
The question that I have is really to do with the source files. I your outline you mentioned that you have the look and feel sorted etc. So does that mean that you have source files /.psds all ready and the cashier can be incorporated into it?
If the above offer sounds like something you would be interested in, I'd love to hear from you.
Regards,
Gray.

 Hi Michael,

Just checked your project details “Design a new onboarding process for a banking app” and I believe that I may be a great fit.

As a UX designer with 3 years of experience, I have previously designed account creation and account opening system flows for a lending app (received a 5-star review from the client). You can check the project details in my portfolio, along with several other designs for e-commerce, healthcare and media companies.

You mentioned that you also need someone experienced with interactive prototyping and InVision. I’m a long-term user of this app. Also familiar with Balsamiq and Adobe XD software. 

I have included information about my rates, and I am confident that I can deliver the first design mockups within 2 weeks as per your deadline. Please contact me so that we can get started.

Best,

Kevin Ninja

P.S. I took a moment to explore your website. It’s very well-designed. If you’re interested in making further changes, I believe I can make some small tweaks to your landing pages to boost conversion rates.

.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.
Dear Michael Wadsworth,

My name is Kyra Ninja and I have worked as a web developer and front-end designer for the past two years. I’m well versed in the following coding languages: Java, HTML5, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and C#. Also, I have significant domain knowledge in the areas of construction and manufacturing as I’ve been largely in developing websites for companies in these industries.

I have an associate’s degree in web development, along with a certificate in user experience design from Coding School. I believe my skill set and background make me an ideal candidate for the position of Lead Website Developer at Smiths Industrial group.

As a contract web developer for Davis Consulting Group, I worked with a variety of small to medium-sized manufacturing and construction companies to create websites and B2B apps for on-site contractors. You can check my development portfolio at Dribble @KyraDesigns. It includes mock-ups of completed websites, landing pages, and several app wireframe demos.

In the past month, I also completed an entire website redesign for the largest industrial flooring contractor in the Midwest. Thus far, that redesign has led to a 50% increase in traffic and a 15% increase in newsletter subscriptions. I am very proud of my technical abilities, however, I believe I also bring value to the table because of my business analysis skills. I can quickly and accurately discern user needs and requirements, then create specifications for meeting those needs.

I’m very excited about the opportunity you have presented and would love to meet with you at your convenience. Please feel free to contact me using any of the methods listed above.

Sincerely,

Kyra Ninja

Dear Ms Brown,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Network Analyst reporting to your director of IT Operations. I am a certified network technician with more than three years of experience supporting IT operations at a major financial institution. Thus, I believe my mastery of Cisco Networks along with my experience as a banking industry employee makes me a great fit for this position at Ellis Area Credit Union. 

I know that fraud prevention is a key concern in the financial services industry. That is why I pursued a career as a network analyst, and why I am also continuing my education as a student of Data Security Policy Management at Washington State University. I have been fortunate to participate in many assignments in my current position that have directly reduced the number of fraud complaints levied by banking customers.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I also hope you will read my attached resume. I am very interested in pursuing this position. Ellis Area Credit Union has established a wonderful reputation for meeting the financial needs of a diverse customer base. I would love to be a part of your team. I am able to meet at your convenience for an interview.

Truly, 

Marcus Ninja
