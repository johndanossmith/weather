Hello.
Thanks for your reply.
Before everything I'd like to confirm with you one thing.
I'd like to communicate in your team in English if possible.
I can't speak in Japanese well but I worked some Japan clients before, so text communication or understanding project by docs is no problem for me.
If everything is ok, I am available at 
11月2日(水) 10:00-18:00
I will wait for your reply.
Best Regards.
Danny Mao
