 Hi
 I'm going to bid with interest of your project.
 Pine Script's syntax is similar to that of C and JavaScript and is easy to learn even for someone with little programming experience.
 However, converting Pine Script to Python 3 can't be a straightforward process. That's why the two languages are quite different from each other. Pine Script is a domain-specific language designed for creating custom technical indicators and trading strategies for use in the TradingView platform. Then, Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications. 
 
 However, there is no impossible. I can do it if you want.
 I'll wait you any time if you want me.
 Regards.
