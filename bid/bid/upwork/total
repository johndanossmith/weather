I have worked as a IT engineer for my last company from October 2021.
I just stated to work as a freelancer so that I have no review but I have good experiences about IT in my company.
I have just started this freelancer work.
So I have not yet many reviews.
But I will try for the best.

And then I am a full time developer , a really individual freelancer who can work 50 hr / week.
I can start work right now and you can hire me over 1 year.
I am ready to build your site with any framework as you want.

Looking for your reply.
Best Regards
