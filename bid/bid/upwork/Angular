Hello.
Hope you and your familiar are safe and healthy

I have 8+ years of experience working with different technologies, C#, Angular, AWS, Rest APIs, and SQL server.
I'm an expert in Angular and i have also rebuilt application from scratch from older version Angular JS to latest version of Angular 12 version and i have done more migration projects too.
In my projects, I'm also able to use source code management tools such as GIT(Github, Bitbucket), SVN and project management tools such as Jira, Asana, Trello, Slack etc. Also, I have experience with integrating APIs (Facebook API (both js and PHP SDKs), Twitter API, Google (map, translate, youtube, etc), Paypal, Zoho, Mailchimp).

I work with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket 5 years.

I have worked as a IT engineer for my last company from October 2021.
I just stated to work as a freelancer so that I have no review but I have good experiences about IT in my company.
I have just started this freelancer work.
So I have not yet many reviews.
But I will try for the best.

I am a full time developer , a really individual freelancer  who can work 40~45 hr / week.
I can start work right now and you can hire me over 1 year.

Feel free to reach out to me, and let's start our mutually beneficial cooperation.
Best regards.
Thanks.
