Hello.
Hope you and your family will be safe and healthy.

I have good experiences with 7 years of Three.js gatsby.js , D3.js.
I've read requirements and ready to create a 3D grid with objects, animations and API's.

Websites we built with Three.js:

I was a very passionate developer and I was responsible, honest, and always provide 100% results in my last company. 
I have worked as a IT engineer for my last company from October 2021.
I just stated to work as a freelancer so that I have no review but I have good experiences about IT in my company.
I have just started this freelancer work.
So I have not yet many reviews.
But I will try for the best.

I am a full time developer , a really individual freelancer  who can work 40~45 hr / week.
I can start work right now and you can hire me over 1 year.

Feel free to reach out to me, and let's start our mutually beneficial cooperation.
Best regards.
Thanks.
