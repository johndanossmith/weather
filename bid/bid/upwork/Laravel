- I have been using Github, a bitbucket for programming management.
- I am also well versed with UI/UX Designs, Graphic Designs, and I would like to represent my skillset (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Wireframing, Website Wireframing, CSS, HTML5, etc.).

And then I am a full time developer , a really individual freelancer who can work 50 hr / week.
I can start work right now and you can hire me over 1 year.
Now let's have a quick conversation on the details to proceed further with this project..

I have worked as a IT engineer for my last company from October 2021.
I just stated to work as a freelancer so that I have no review but I have good experiences about IT in my company.
I have just started this freelancer work.
So I have not yet many reviews.
But I will try for the best.

Best regards
