Hi, nice to meet you.
I am very interested in your project and would like to contribute to its completion. I am an ambitious Shopify&WordPress CMS developer with over 5 years of experience as a Shopify & WordPress ECsite developer and good at developing themes and templates.
I've been created landing pages based on html, css, js and ajax technologies for several companies over the years, creating and posting stores based on CMS, and I also have freelancer experience.
I have read your details and can cooperate with you. I am very confident for all skills you want and I can solve this problem perfectly.
I will do my best for your project.
Working hours will follow your opinion and weekend work is also possible.
